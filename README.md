# Hi there 👋

My name is **beiatrix**. I'm a software engineer and designer with a specialization in frontend JavaScript.

- 🎨 Before launching my career in software engineering, I worked professionally as a graphic designer and illustrator

- 👩🏻‍💻 I find joy in being able to use both skill sets!

- 🌿 I also create content on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/beiatrix) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beiatrix.art)

- 🚀 I built my personal website with `ionic` + `vue`

- 📚 I love to learn about personal finance, psychology, and philosophy

- 🤖 My go-to Netflix genres are comedy, documentary, and guilty-pleasure reality shows

- 🌻 For fun, I love going on hiking adventures with my boyfriend and dog, practicing hot yoga, drawing and painting, eating incredible foods, and traveling with family and friends!
