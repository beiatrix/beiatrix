# Hi there 👋

My name is **beiatrix**. I'm a software engineer and designer with a specialization in frontend JavaScript.

- 🎨 Before launching my career in software engineering, I worked professionally as a graphic designer and illustrator

- 👩🏻‍💻 At my current role, I get to use both skill sets!

- 🌿 I also create content on YouTube to share what I know

- 🚀 I built my personal website with `ionic` + `vue`

- 📚 I love to learn about personal finance, psychology, and philosophy

- 🤖 My go-to Netflix genres are comedy, documentary, and guilty-pleasure reality shows

- 🌻 For fun, I love to go on hiking adventures with the boyfriend and dog, run by the beach, do hot yoga, cook and bake, tend to my houseplants, and travel the world!
