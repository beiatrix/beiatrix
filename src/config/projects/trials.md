The journey begins on the Revolution Prep website's quiz landing page. Here, the user selects one of four key concerns: high-stakes exam, AP exam, academics, or executive functioning.

Clicking the "Take the Quiz" button launches an embedded Typeform questionnaire designed to assess the user's specific tutoring needs.

Upon completing a quiz, the user advances to results page where they receive a personalized tutoring recommendation along with a discounted trial enrollment.

To claim the offer, they enter an email and click the "Let's Go" call-to-action button.

Upon a successful purchase, they are automatically logged in to the **[Student Dashboard](/projects/student-dashboard)**, where they can go through the **[Tutor Self-Match](/projects/tutor-self-match)** process to select their tutor and schedule their trial sessions.

Two automated reminder emails support this process:

If the user hasn't booked their trial tutoring yet and there are seven days before the trial expires, they receive a reminder email encouraging them to do so.

If the user still hasn't started their trial and there are two days before the trial expires, they receive a final reminder email.
