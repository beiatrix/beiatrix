The journey begins on the Revolution Prep website's quiz landing page. Here, the user selects one of four key concerns: high-stakes exam, AP exam, academics, or executive functioning.

Clicking the "Take the Quiz" button launches an embedded Typeform questionnaire designed to assess the user's specific tutoring needs.

Upon completing a quiz, the user advances to results page where they receive a personalized tutoring recommendation along with a discounted trial enrollment.

Upon a successful purchase, they are automatically logged in to the **[Student Dashboard](/projects/student-dashboard)**, where they can go through the **[Tutor Self-Match](/projects/tutor-self-match)** process to select their tutor and schedule their trial sessions.

Two automated reminder emails support this process:

If the user hasn't booked their trial tutoring yet and there are seven days before the trial expires, they receive a reminder email encouraging them to do so.

If the user still hasn't started their trial and there are two days before the trial expires, they receive a final reminder email.

This project presented an intriguing challenge due to its integration of multiple platforms: landing pages built in Wordpress and HubSpot, quizzes developed with Typeform, emails powered by Vero, and a checkout cart app built in Angular.

One of my key contributions was implementing the quiz landing page on the WordPress site, where I embedded the Typeform as a modal for a seamless user experience. 

I also developed the quiz result landing pages in HubSpot, particularly the AP Exams and Executive Functioning key concerns.

A critical integration I managed was redirecting users from the HubSpot quiz result pages to the Angular checkout cart app. This included pre-populating the cart with a trial tutor package and the userâ€™s email for a smoother transition.

Additionally, I created both trial reminder emails in Vero.

During QA rounds, I addressed and resolved bugs across various platforms and pages.

Finally, I led the implementation of analytics using Mixpanel. This work was crucial in enabling seamless tracking of the user journey across platforms, providing valuable insights to improve the experience.
