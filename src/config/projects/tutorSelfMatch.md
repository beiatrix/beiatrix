The Tutor Self-Match flow empowers students to match with their own Revolution Prep tutor based on their preferred tutoring subject and availability.

This flow is the successor to a more manual process where a Revolution Prep team member would gather information from the **[Tutor Matching Form](/projects/tutor-matching-form)** to hand-select a tutor for the student.

This flow begins on the Schedule Sessions page of the **[Student Dashboard](/projects/student-dashboard)**. Clicking the "Add A Tutor" button takes them to step 1 of the matching form.

On Step 1, the student selects their desired tutoring subject, session duration, and frequency for tutoring. Once these fields are completed, the student can click "Continue: Availability" to move on to the next step.

On Step 2, the student indicates their availability on the calendar. Help text indicates how much availability is required, while the progress bar keeps track of how much time has been selected. Once the progress bar turns green, the student can click "Continue: Schedule" to move on to the final step.

This availability calendar is re-used in a few other places, such as the **[Scheduling Flow](/projects/scheduling-flow)** and **[Enrollment Wizard](/projects/enrollment-wizard)**.

As the student enters Step 3 of the flow, an interstitial plays as the tutor-matching algorithm calculates a best match.

Finally, a dialog presents the student with their best tutor match.

The student can now select their desired session times with their recommended tutor.

They have the option to expand "See alternative tutors" and browse their schedules as well.

Clicking "Read more" opens a dialog with the tutor's profile information.

If the student selects fewer than all of their available hours, a dialog appears encouraging them to book more.

![Tutor Self-Match - Step 3 - Underbooked Hours Dialog](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/tutor-self-match/step-3-underbooked-hours-dialog.jpg)

Once their desired session times are booked, a success modal appears.

![Tutor Self-Match - Step 3 - Success Dialog](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/tutor-self-match/step-3-success-dialog.jpg)

Closing this modal returns them to the Schedule Sessions page. Now, they may click "Book Session" with their existing tutor to go to the **[Scheduling Flow](/projects/scheduling-flow)**, or click "Add A Tutor" to match with another tutor once more.
