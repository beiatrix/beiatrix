<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary);" />

For the initial launch of the Student Dashboard in 2021, I helped gather requirements, design UI/UX with Adobe XD, build features in Vue and Nuxt, write unit tests with Jest, and provide continuous improvements and bug fixes post-launch.

This incarnation of the Student Dashboard is the successor to a legacy app built in AngularJS. I was instrumental in crafting the look and feel of the next-generation apps. Here are some side-by-side screenshots comparing the legacy and next versions of the Student Dashboard:

Here is a sample of work done in XD to refresh the design:

![Design - Activity Feed](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/student-dashboard/design-activity-feed.jpg)

![Design - Videos](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/student-dashboard/design-videos.jpg)

I had my hand in the development of almost every single page. I built much of the Exams, Help, and Videos pages; provided foundational work for the Activity Feed page and layout for the Help Now page; and fleshed out the forms in the Profile page. Among my most impactful code contributions were in the Schedule page and Schedule Sessions views, which contained critical functionality: allowing students to schedule and manage sessions with their tutors. I implemented the calendar components initially with Vuetify before rewriting them in FullCalendar in 2023. Real-time updates to sessions and availabilities are powered by Pusher.

This Student Dashboard is part of a monorepo that also contains the next generations of our internal Admin and Tutor Dashboards.* Another contribution I made in this monorepo (that can't be seen in screenshots!) is an NPM package for reusable fixtures, used for writing unit tests across multiple apps and repositories within the organization. This package helped [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) up our testing code and improve our team's developer experience.

Over the years, we continued to add many features to support key business initiatives, such as the addition of the **[Tutor Matching Form](/projects/tutor-matching)**, **[Exam Player](/projects/exam-player)**, and **[Enrollment Wizard](/projects/enrollment-wizard)**.

In 2024, we released a major update: a rewrite of the entire monorepo from Nuxt 2 / Vue 2 to Nuxt 3 / Vue 3. We migrated from Lerna to Turborepo for our monorepo, Vuex to Pinia for state management, Jest to Vitest for unit testing, and Axios to oFetch for API calls. For this upgrade, I challenged myself to improve my DevOps skills by architecting an automated CI/CD pipeline that handled versioning and publishing with Changesets, deployment with Vercel, bundling packages in Turborepo with `tsup`, and building/linting/testing our feature PRs with GitHub Actions.

*<small>The "Help Now" Text Chat is actually a separate repository: a full-stack Ruby on Rails application. One of my teammates built most of the desktop chat app! I helped out with styling and some small features/fixes.</small>
