In response to the launch of the digital SAT in 2023, Revolution Prep developed an exam player to offer students a practice exam experience that closely mirrors the official test.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="start-exam">Launching An Exam</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

To launch an exam, the student begins on the Exams page of the **[Student Dashboard](/projects/student-dashboard#exams)**.

Clicking the "Take Digital Exam" button opens the exam player, where the student lands on the Configure page.

![Start Exam](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/start-exam.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="configure">Configure Page</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

On the Configure page, the student selects a test from the dropdown menus. Once an exam is selected, the "Launch Exam Now" button becomes enabled.

![Configure Page](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/configure-page.gif)

Optionally, the student can turn on "Practice Mode," which allows the user to proceed to the next portion of the exam at their earliest convenience. They may also toggle on Accommodations and Supports, such as extended time for Reading, Math, or Breaks.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="instructions">Instructions Page</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The instruction page contains some information about the exam experience.

![Instructions Page](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/instructions-page.jpg)

Clicking "Next" brings the student to the first question of the first section of the exam.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="exam-player-panels">Exam Player Panels</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The exam player view is divided into two main panels: a left panel containing a passage or instructions, and a question with answer choices on the right. These panels may expand and collapse to conform to the student's viewing preferences.

![Panels](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/panels.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="mark-for-review">Mark For Review</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

Clicking the bookmark icon next to a question number allows the student to mark a question for review at a later time.

![Mark For Review](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/mark-for-review.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="option-eliminator">Option Eliminator</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

Clicking the strikethrough "ABC" icon allows a student to use a "cross-out" feature to use the process of elimination on answer choices.

![Cross Out](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/cross-out.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="question-navigator">Question Navigator</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the footer of the exam player, a button with copy "Question X of X" keeps track of where the student is in the exam. Clicking this button opens a popover that allows students to quickly see which questions are still unanswered or marked for review, and navigate freely between the questions in the current module.

![Question Navigator](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/question-navigator.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="timing">Timing</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the center of the header is a timer that counts down the time remaining in the current exam module. The student has the ability to toggle showing or hiding this timer.

![Timer](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/timer.gif)

When a module is about to run out of time, an alert appears indicating that there are 5 minutes remaining. If time expires before a student completes the module, the answers they have submitted so far will still be saved.

![Timer - 5-Minute Warning](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/timer-5-minute-warning.jpg)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="review-page">Review Page</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

At the end of a module, a student can see an overview of all of its questions. Here, they have an opportunity to revisit unanswered or bookmarked questions before they move forward.

In "Test Day Mode," the student is automatically advanced to the next module once the timer elapses.

![Review Page - Test Day Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/review-page-test-day-mode.jpg)

In "Practice Mode," the student can click "Next" to move onward at any time.

![Review Page - Practice Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/review-page-practice-mode.jpg)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="reading-and-writing">Reading and Writing Section</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the upper left, the directions popover describes the format of the Reading and Writing section. This popover opens automatically at the beginning of each module.

![Reading and Writing - Directions Popover](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/reading-and-writing-directions.jpg)

In the Reading and Writing questions, a student can highlight a portion of a passage, then click "Annotate" to write an annotation, which appears over the highlighted areas upon creation and on mouseover. The student has the ability to edit and delete their annotations too.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="break">Break</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The Break page appears in the middle of the exam, between the Reading and Writing Section and the Math Section. It contains a timer for 10 minutes.

If a student had selected an accommodation for extended time or more frequent breaks in the Configure page, the Break page would appear accordingly.

In "Test Day Mode," testing resumes once the break timer is over.

![Break Page - Test Day Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/break-page-test-day-mode.gif)

In "Practice Mode," the student may end their break and continue testing at any time.

![Break Page - Practice Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/break-page-practice-mode.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="math-section">Math Section</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The Directions popover outlines information about the Math Section and its two types of questions: multiple-choice questions and student-produced response questions.

![Math - Directions Popover](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-directions.gif)

In the Math questions, a graphing calculator is available for the student to use.

![Math - Calculator](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-calculator.gif)

Additionally, the student may open a reference sheet, containing handy formulas and diagrams.

![Math - Reference](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-reference.gif)

The student-produced response questions contain an input field and a preview area that renders math expressions.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="more-menu">More Menu</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the upper right, clicking "More" opens a menu with additional options and resources.

![More Menu](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu.jpg)

Clicking "Help" opens a modal with more information about the exam player.

![More Menu - Help Modal](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu-help-modal.gif)

Another menu item is a toggle to turn "Practice Mode" on or off. The dashed border lines at the header and footer of the app provide a quick visual indicator: the grey border indicates that the student is in "Practice Mode," whereas the colorful dashed border indicates that the student is in "Test Day Mode."
  
![More Menu - Practice Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu-practice-mode.gif)

Clicking "Save and Exit" opens a modal confirming that the student wishes to exit the test. Clicking "Save and Exit" in the modal allows the student to save their progress on their current device before being redirected back to the Student Dashboard.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="end-exam">Completing an Exam</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

When the student completes all the modules of the exam, they see the Complete Page.

![Complete Page](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/complete-page.jpg)

Clicking the "View Your Score" call-to-action button navigates the student back to the Student Dashboard Exams Page, where they can see their score report.
