## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="start-exam">Launching An Exam</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

To launch an exam, the student begins on the Exams page of the **[Student Dashboard](/projects/student-dashboard#exams)**.

Clicking the "Take Digital Exam" button opens the exam player, where the student lands on the Configure page.

![Start Exam](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/start-exam.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="configure">Configure Page</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

On the Configure page, the student selects a test from the dropdown menus. Once an exam is selected, the "Launch Exam Now" button becomes enabled.

![Configure Page](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/configure-page.gif)

Optionally, the student can turn on "Practice Mode," which allows them to proceed to the next portion of the exam at their earliest convenience. They may also toggle on Accommodations and Supports, such as extended time for Reading, Math, or Breaks.

Clicking "Next" brings the student to the first question of the first section of the exam.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="exam-player-panels">Exam Player Panels</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The exam player view is divided into two main panels: a left panel containing a passage or instructions, and a right panel with a question and answer choices. These panels may expand and collapse to conform to the student's viewing preferences.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="question-navigator">Question Navigator</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the footer of the exam player, a button labeled "Question X of X" keeps track of the student's progress. Clicking this button opens a popover that allows students to quickly see which questions are still unanswered or marked for review and navigate freely between the questions in the current module.

![Question Navigator](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/question-navigator.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="timing">Timing</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the center of the header, a timer counts down the time remaining in the current exam module. The student can control whether the timer is visible or hidden.

![Timer](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/timer.gif)

When a module is about to run out of time, an alert appears indicating that there are 5 minutes remaining. If time expires before the student completes the module, the answers they have submitted so far will still be saved.

![Timer - 5-Minute Warning](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/timer-5-minute-warning.jpg)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="review-page">Review Page</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

At the end of a module, the student can see an overview of all its questions. Here, they have an opportunity to revisit unanswered or bookmarked questions before moving forward.

In "Test Day Mode," the student is automatically advanced to the next module once the timer elapses.

![Review Page - Test Day Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/review-page-test-day-mode.jpg)

In "Practice Mode," the student can click "Next" to move onward at any time.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="break">Break</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The Break page appears in the middle of the exam, between the Reading and Writing Section and the Math Section. It contains a timer for 10 minutes.

If a student had selected an accommodation for extended time or more frequent breaks on the Configure page, the Break page would adjust accordingly.

In "Test Day Mode," testing resumes once the break timer is over.

![Break Page - Test Day Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/break-page-test-day-mode.gif)

In "Practice Mode," the student may end their break and continue testing at any time.

![Break Page - Practice Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/break-page-practice-mode.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="math-section">Math Section</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

The Directions popover outlines information about the Math Section and its two types of questions: multiple-choice questions and student-produced response questions.

![Math - Directions Popover](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-directions.gif)

In the Math questions, a graphing calculator is available for the student to use.

![Math - Calculator](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-calculator.gif)

Additionally, the student may open a reference sheet containing handy formulas and diagrams.

![Math - Reference](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/math-reference.gif)

The student-produced response questions contain an input field and a preview area that renders math expressions.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="more-menu">More Menu</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the upper right, clicking "More" opens a menu with additional options and resources.

![More Menu](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu.jpg)

Clicking "Help" opens a modal with more information about the exam player.

![More Menu - Help Modal](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu-help-modal.gif)

Another menu item is a toggle to turn "Practice Mode" on or off. The dashed border lines at the header and footer of the app provide a quick visual indicator: the grey border indicates that the student is in "Practice Mode," whereas the colorful dashed border indicates that the student is in "Test Day Mode."

![More Menu - Practice Mode](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/more-menu-practice-mode.gif)

Clicking the "Save and Exit" menu item opens a modal confirming that the student wishes to exit the test. Clicking "Save and Exit" in the modal allows the student to save their progress on their current device before being redirected back to the Student Dashboard.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="end-exam">Completing an Exam</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

When the student completes all the modules of the exam, they see the Complete Page.

![Complete Page](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/complete-page.jpg)

Clicking the "View Your Score" call-to-action button navigates the student back to the Student Dashboard Exams Page, where they can see their score report.

![View Score](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/view-score.jpg)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="mobile-modal">Mobile Modal</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

Because the Exam Player is optimized for larger screens, we display a modal to mobile users, encouraging them to use a desktop browser for the best experience.

![Mobile Modal](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/mobile-modal.gif)

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="demo">Demo Version</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

We also created a [Demo Version](https://digital-demo.revolutionprep.com/) of the app that is available to everyone, with no authentication required. The Demo app contains most of the same features as the Exam Player app but uses sample content.

![Demo](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/exam-player/demo.gif)

# **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="my-contributions">My Contributions</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary);" />

To develop this app, our team closely examined its precedent: the official College Board Digital SAT. We built our own recreation using Ionic and Vue 3, with Pinia for state management.

On the frontend, I was instrumental in creating a static prototype for nearly every component, providing a solid foundation on which our team could build. Early in the project, I led key pair programming sessions to collaborate on establishing the main user flows of the app. This involved setting the start of the flow on the Configure Page, followed by the Instructions page, and then conditionally rendering the Exam Player, Review page, or Break page, culminating in the Complete page.

Some of the components I worked on included the exam player header; the Help, Accommodations, and Mobile modals; the timing feature, including the 5-minute warning alert; directions in the popovers and the left panel for Student Produced Responses; and draggable containers for the Calculator and Reference Sheet. I also integrated the Desmos script for the graphing calculator and the MathJax script to render math expressions in the browser.

As a designer, I created custom icons and SVG assets in Adobe Illustrator, particularly the conditionally-colored dashed borders of the header and footer. Additionally, I worked to improve the quality of the images.

For the Demo app, I designed and built the branded header and handled some DevOps tasks, such as setting up the Vercel environment and assigning custom domains to our `main`, `staging`, and `release` branches.
