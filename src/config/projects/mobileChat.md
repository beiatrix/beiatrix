Revolution Now for Mobile is a service that allows students to connect with tutors via the **[Revolution Prep Mobile App](/projects/mobile-chat)**, where they can send text messages, share photos of their homework, open a whiteboard to create drawings, and draw on images previously sent in the chat.

It is the mobile adaptation of **[Revolution Now for Desktop](/projects/student-dashboard#text-chat)**.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="chat-view">Chat View</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

If this is the student's first time logging into this view, a marketing card appears, encouraging the student to opt into a trial of Revolution Now. Tapping "I want to try 3 sessions" takes them to the main Chat view.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

      alt="Marketing Card" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

The Chat view contains a list of all the student's study areas in which they can receive support. Returning users will see this page by default.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">

  </div>
</div>

If a student has never selected any subjects before, they will see an alert prompting them to do so.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/no-subjects.jpg"
      alt="No Subjects" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Below the list of subjects are two buttons: "Edit Subjects" and "View Hours." Tapping "Edit Subjects" opens the Select Subjects modal, which contains many areas of study to choose from, organized by category.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img

      alt="Edit Subjects" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Tapping "View Hours" opens a modal displaying the hours that tutors are available to chat.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/view-hours.jpg"
      alt="View Hours"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Finally, tapping "Ask a Tutor" next to a subject opens the Room view, where the student may enter a chat with a tutor.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="room-view">Room View</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

In the Room view, the student can exchange text messages with their tutor in real time. Students can compose a message in the input field and tap the paper airplane icon to send it. A typing indicator in the lower left shows when the tutor is writing a message.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img

      alt="Room View" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Tapping the camera button allows the student to snap a photo of their homework and send it in the chat.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/send-photo-camera.gif"
      alt="Send Photo - Camera"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Tapping the "Draw On" button opens the whiteboard, allowing users to mark up an image from a previous message.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/draw-on.gif"
      alt="Draw On"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Tapping the paintbrush icon also opens the whiteboard, where the student can send drawings.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/whiteboard.gif"
      alt="Whiteboard"
    />
  </div>
</div>

In addition to sending photos from the camera, the student also has the option to select images from their library.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/send-photo-library.gif"
      alt="Send Photo - Library"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Finally, the student can tap "End Chat" in the upper right when they are ready to leave the room. They are asked to provide a reason for ending the chat.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/end-chat.gif"
      alt="End Chat"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Tapping "End Chat" in the modal opens the "Review Chat" modal, where the student can provide a star rating and additional feedback for their tutor.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/review-chat.gif"
      alt="Review Chat"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="notifications">Notifications</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

If a student sends the app to the background while a chat is in progress, they can continue to receive notifications for incoming messages from their tutor.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/notification-message.gif"
      alt="Notification - Message"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If the student has been inactive for more than 5 minutes, a modal and notification appear, advising the student to send a message. Otherwise, the chat will automatically close in one minute.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/notification-inactive.gif"
      alt="Notification - Inactive"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Finally, if the room has ended (whether due to student inactivity, the tutor leaving due to an urgent matter, or otherwise), the view displays the time and reason for the chat ending, as well as a call to action button to begin a new chat.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

# **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="my-contributions">My Contributions</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary);" />

In the winter and spring of 2023, I served as the technical lead for the Revolution Now for Mobile project. 

I started off with a product requirements document created by the product manager, which contains a list of use cases:

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/user-stories.jpg"
      alt="User Stories"
    />
  </div>
</div>

With the user stories as my guide, I designed every screen in high-fidelity in Adobe XD:

![Mobile Chat - Designs](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/mobile-chat-designs.jpg)

Next, I created an architecture document containing an overview of the overall approach and technologies involved in building a mobile chat application, followed by a component drill-down.

<div
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/architecture-document.jpg"
      alt="Architecture Document"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Referencing the product requirements document and my architecture document, I created a Jira epic and populated it with tickets. Then, I worked with the team to prioritize, assign story points, and delegate the tasks.
 
<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 40%; height: auto; margin-right: 2rem">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/jira-epic.jpg"
      alt="Jira Epic" 
    />
  </div>
  <div style="width: 40%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/jira-tickets.jpg"
      alt="Jira Tickets"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Furthermore, I organized numerous meetings, including a kickoff, scoping meetings, code walkthroughs, and testing sessions including external stakeholders.

For my frontend contributions, I set up the infrastructure to send real-time chat messages via WebSockets using `@rails/actioncable`, established the new Chat and Room pages and state management stores with `pinia`, and implemented push notifications for chat messages and room inactivity in our Ionic/Vue mobile app.

I paired with a colleague who specializes in the backend to modify **[Revolution Now for Desktop](/projects/student-dashboard#text-chat)**, a fullstack Ruby on Rails app, and the backend for the mobile chat frontend to consume. I updated models and controllers for the chat rooms and messages, amended background jobs to support message and inactivity push notifications, and created an "online" indicator badge that appears in the tutor-facing app:

![Mobile Chat - Online Indicator](https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-chat/online-indicator.jpg)

This is a project that enabled me to gain a breadth of experience: organizing as a leader, putting on my UI/UX designer hat, and contributing as a developer to both the frontend and backend.
