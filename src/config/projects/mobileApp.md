When the student downloads the app for the first time, they see the home screen on the left below. Tapping "log in" takes them to the login form, where they can authenticate to enter the app. Alternatively, tapping "forgot password" allows the user to reset their password.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="live-help">Live Help</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

Upon logging in, the user is taken to the Live Help view by default.

If this is the user's first time ever logging in, they may tap "Let me see the sessions!" to opt into a free trial of Revolution Now â€“ a service that allows students to connect with a tutor for quick questions or homework help.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

      alt="Help Now Trial" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once the student is enrolled in Revolution Now, this is the default view they will see. At the top, chips indicate the next available session time and the number of free sessions available. The centerpiece is a slide group of cards displaying upcoming tutoring sessions. The lower half of the page contains list items of the student's study areas.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  </div>
</div>

Tapping the "What is this anyway?" banner opens a marketing modal with more information about the Revolution Now program.

      alt="Marketing Modal" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

At the bottom of the page, students can tap "Edit Subjects" to open a subject selection modal. Adding a subject allows the student to view sessions for that subject right away.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

      alt="Select Subjects Modal" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

In the slide group of session cards, a student can tap "Save Spot" to easily reserve their spot with a tutor. Tapping this button opens a detail view for their session. When they return to the main Live Help screen, they can now see their reservation under a section called "Reserved Sessions."

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

      alt="Save Spot" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Below "Reserved Sessions" is a "Browse Schedules" session. Tapping a subject name allows the student to see all the upcoming tutoring availabilities for that subject.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">

      alt="Subject Show Page" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

To cancel a reservation, the student can tap an "Unreserve" button in the session detail view. They can do so by tapping either the "Details" button of a session card or a session list item under "Reserved Sessions."

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

Tapping "Exams" in the footer tab navigator takes the student to the Exams view. Here, the student can see an overview of their exam scores, use their camera to score an exam, or use the self-proctor feature to administer a practice exam.

</div>

Once permissions are granted, the student can use their camera to snap photos of their exam.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img 
      src="https://beiatrix.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/mobile-app/score-exam.gif"
      alt="Score Exam" 
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once all the images have been uploaded, a first-time user will see help slides showing the student how to review their submitted answers.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"
>
  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
    <img

When they're finished reviewing their answers, clicking "Submit" opens a celebratory score announcement modal if this is the first exam score they've ever submitted.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

  <div style="width: 30%; height: auto;">

Tapping "Start Exam" launches the proctoring feature. It comprises a timer with audible cues that notify the student when a section is beginning or ending, or announce a break in between sections. Ambient illustrations float in the background, with ambient room sounds that may be toggled on or off. The stop button allows the student to exit the flow, and the skip button enables them to skip to the next section.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

If the student sends the app to the background, they can see a notification with details about their in-progress exam.

## **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="notifications-modal">Notifications</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary-tint);" />

A student logging in for the very first time will see a modal prompting them to allow notifications.

<div 
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;"

# **<a style="color: var(--ion-color-dark);" name="my-contributions">My Contributions</a>**

<hr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--ion-color-secondary);" />

As a developer, I built various features across the two main views of the app in Ionic and Vue, implemented state management in Pinia, wrote unit tests in Jest, helped prepare the app for publishing to the app stores, and provided bug fixes and improvements post-launch.

In the Exams view, I worked on the exam summary page, the score report page containing a ChartJS graph and list of scored exams, and the entirety of the self-proctor feature (comprising a start page, various modals, functions to interact with the filesystem for the "Download Answersheet" button, the timer feature with floating SVG images, and local notifications).

In the Live Help view, I developed the marketing card, the next live session and remaining sessions chips, and the "Browse Schedules" session.

Furthermore, I pitched in towards the push notifications feature and built the modal to request notification permissions.

I also worked on some global elements, including the header app bar and footer tab navigator, and performed a styling pass across all views of the app.

Finally, I prepared screenshots showcasing the mobile app for our App Store listings and helped submit the app to the App Store and Google Play Store for review and publishing.

In 2023, I was given the opportunity to lead the technical effort for a major update to the mobile app: the addition of **[Mobile Chat](/projects/mobile-chat)**.
